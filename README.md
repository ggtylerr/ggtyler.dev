A modern portfolio and blog, made with Astro.

Currently in public alpha. A lot of parts are still missing.

To run, [download Node 16](https://nodejs.org) and `corepack enable`, then run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

To build and deploy:
```sh
yarn build

```

npm and pnpm also works, **but PRs made with their lockfiles still present will be ignored.**
