    Welcome to the new site! 
    The blogposts haven't changed, so if this is the first time you're seeing it, 
    you won't notice a thing. If you'd look at the bottom of the screen, though...

    <br/>

    Woah! There's now icons on them that look a million times better! 
    And if you hover over them, you can still see what they are!

    <br/>

    There's a ton of other changes as well, so for ease of access 
    (and 'cause I'm lazy), here's a quick list of them:
</section>
<section>
    * "WIP" notice removed from front page
    * All other notices removed for the time being (They may come back if needed)
    * Footer area replaced with icons and tooltips
    * Made footer dynamic to screen size (unless you have an ungodly small screen that's under ~200px wide)
    * Added Discord server to footer
    * Background added to blog post list
    * Weird code style in blog post list fixed
    * Projects page completely revamped
      - Projects are no longer in two separate pages, now in two separate areas on one page
      - All projects now in new 'card' design
        * Thank you to Matthais#8217 from the [CodeSupport community](https://codesupport.dev/) for helping out with an odd bug with this new design, regarding its hover functionality.
      - Most project text has been rewritten
      - mutat.io added to the released project list since the excuse of it being in alpha doesn't work when 99% of my projects are a WIP
      - Meme Dumpyard removed as the source is no longer available (it was also generally terrible anyways)
    * Socials page now use new 'card' design for accounts
    * Added new "Other" page that includes pages that aren't a blog post, project, or social media account.
    * Added resume
      - Hosted version does not include my phone number or address. (Information can be provided if you can verify you're in a position to both hire developers and not leak it to the world.)
    * Added brand kit
    * Added sitemap
    * Added credits
    * Added Discord embed functionality (which also happens to be basic OpenGraph support) to all pages
    * File structure cleaned up
    * New favicon, along with proper formats
    * Pages no longer link to the favicon by URL
    * Additional redirects added to index.js script to reflect new file structure
    * Added [MIT License](/LICENSE.txt)

    Yeah, I wasn't kidding when I said a "ton". 
    I'm pretty sure this changelog can rival even Minecraft's changelogs. 
    [In fact, it can.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_1.16.5)

    <br/>

    If you have any feedback on the new site, or just want to pop in and say hello, 
    you should check out [the Discord server.](https://discord.gg/A4ccPpKp7b) 
    Yes, I know, shilling again. It's the best way to get in touch with me, 
    though, and I could use some company in there. Seriously, only 11 people are in it. 
    5 of which are people I know IRL. Plz.

    <br/>

    Well, hope you guys enjoy it, and I'll see you all in the next blog post.

    <br/>
