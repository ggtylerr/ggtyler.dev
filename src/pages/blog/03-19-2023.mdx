    This post has been rewritten to not be a two-parter and include
    some more recent Discord stuff. [Please read that instead!](/blog/06-01-2023)

    Hi there!

    Sorry for being slow on this post and updates in general.
    I've been feeling pretty depressed and stressed out lately and 
    have been dealing with work and future plans. Not to mention I 
    was sick for a few days from food poisoning. To make up for 
    this, this post and the next one is much longer. I've also been 
    doing commits on the [dev branch of the repo.](https://github.com/ggtylerr/ggtyler.dev/tree/dev)
    If you want to see it (along with rough drafts of posts), 
    it's public on [dev.ggtyler.dev](https://dev.ggtyler.dev)

    Site Updates:
    * Brand Kit fully completed
    * Credits page added
    * Astro updated to v2
      - Also updated all dependencies
    * Make Theme Switcher follow Backslash design standard
    * Proper description on 02/12/2023
    * Various minor style changes

    When you think of chat apps, what's the first one that
    comes to mind? Probably Discord. Maybe Skype, MS Teams,
    Slack, or TeamSpeak, depending on where you come from.
    Maybe even Revolt, Matrix, or IRC, if you're more into
    tech.

    <br/>

    But which one is best? And better yet, why is there so
    many of them?!

    <br/>
    
    ...Capitalism. That's why. Okay, bye!
</section>
<section>
    Okay, but seriously, which one is best? Obviously
    there's differences between all of them that better
    suits other kinds of people, such as business and
    gaming, but objectively speaking, what's the king of
    chat apps?

    <br/>

    Well, based on popularity, it's probably Discord.
    *(Really it's WhatsApp or maybe WeChat but we aren't 
    counting strictly text apps.)*

    Discord is great. I've been a user since Jan 2016,
    about 7 months after it was made public. It has an
    intuitive yet accessible UI, has tons of features,
    especially if you use BetterDiscord, and is used
    by pretty much every tech / game / internet related
    community. I love it.

    <br/>

    Unfortunately, Discord is far from perfect. Under
    the hood, Discord is kind of a nightmare. All of
    their current clients are made in React, a UI
    framework for HTML/CSS/JS. Non-web clients are
    made in Electron or React Native.
</section>

    <h4 class="text-xl" id="react">
        The problem with React
        (and web-based Desktop frameworks)
    </h4>
    <hr/>

    React isn't *exactly* bad. This site uses a little
    bit of it, and for websites, it's perfectly fine. 
    Although, nowadays, it'd be best to either use Astro 
    (to be able to use other frameworks and for 
    client-side performance and loading), or to use a
    more performant and reliable framework, like Vue,
    Svelte, or Solid.

    <br/>
    
    But for desktop and mobile, web-based apps are a
    worringly common practice nowadays that
    significantly hurts system resources. If you thought
    Chrome was a RAM hog, try and imagine every single
    app you use running a completely separate instance
    of Chrome. That's essentially what the industry is
    currently heading, and Discord is one of the major
    apps doing this.

    <br/>
    
    If you're new to programming, or you or your
    company doesn't have enough resources, it's
    perfectly fine to do this. Making a new, separate
    program can be difficult and time-consuming,
    especially for Desktops. The problem is, Discord
    is definitely not a new company, and they certainly
    have more than enough resources. In fact, they HAD
    a native version at one point - the Android app
    was completely native, and worked perfectly fine,
    if only a little late on updates. But ~7 months ago,
    they switched to React Native for that platform as
    well. [They even made a press release for it.](https://discord.com/blog/android-react-native-framework-update)

    <br/>
    
    This is, by far, the worst update they have done.
    The new version is far more buggy, laggy, and
    overall worse than the previous version. If you
    are using an Android device, I strongly encourage
    you to either rollback the app, or to use [Aliucord.](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord)

    <br/>

    What I still don't understand to this day is why
    they went with this, especially when they have
    enough resources to make [entire party games and
    a framework specifically for handling them.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)
    Obviously it's behind Nitro, but still. Speaking
    of which...

    <h4 class="text-xl" id="nitro">
        The problem with Nitro
    </h4>
    <hr/>
    Now, obviously, Discord needs lots of money to run.
    They have thousands of server nodes and possibly
    hundreds of employees. But Discord frequently locks highly
    requested features (such as a higher server limit, or soon,
    custom themes) behind Nitro, a monthly subscription that
    gives you more features. They can also add or remove features
    at will.

    <br/>

    A few years ago, Nitro also acted like Game Pass, where you
    get a selection of games along with the other Nitro features.
    This isn't like the recent Activities (party games in VC that
    can be activated by someone with Nitro), these were actual games.

    <br/>

    [Discord cited a lack of use](https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/13/20864896/discords-nitro-games-library-shut-down-removed)
    as the main reason, but this is clearly false - everyone I knew
    who had access to this used it, and absolutely nobody was
    happy with this announcement. What makes this even more insulting
    is that after this happened, they announced Activities, which is
    effectively a replacement of this (and music bots.) Not only was
    this costly since they not only developed the framework for this,
    but they had to make these games from scratch. *And barely anyone
    uses it.*

    <h4 class="text-xl" id="disc-misc">
        Disc's Misc. other problems
    </h4>
    <hr/>
    There's much, *much* more problems, but it'll take forever to talk
    about all of them. So we're going to quickly talk about a few of
    the more important ones.

    <br/>

    * Discord's theme change in 2022 is horrid.

    The new logo is fine, but the logo font is garbage (and used to be
    in every single channel/server name in the app before Discord started 
    using their own font) and the colors can cause problems for some 
    people. Also, it doesn't even pass accessibility tests, which was the 
    entire point of having new colors.

    <br/>

    * Discord has a love-hate relationship with Developers

    While Discord has done a lot for developers (hell, one of my first
    projects was a Discord bot), they've also made several choices that
    directly go against its devs, like how bots can no longer read
    message content without specific access by Discord (or its in < 100
    servers), how bots needed to be reinvited for slash commands, and
    how custom clients are constantly being threatened to be removed
    or broken.

    <br/>

    * New features attempt to kill partner apps

    [Discord recently came out with an App Directory,](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9360431966359-Welcome-to-the-App-Directory-)
    which, while a nice feature, is going to kill sites like Top.gg.
    These sites mainly have bot listings and is going to be a direct
    competitor with Discord's built-in directory. Obviously it's better
    to have this directly in the app, but multiple people rely on these
    sites for an active income. Not only does this affect the staff,
    but top.gg has a custom ad setup where people bid specifically
    for that site. No Google Ads or anything like that. Multiple devs, 
    sites, and others rely on these ads due to the unique market. In
    fact, I personally know two people who use them, and one of them
    happens to be the server hoster.

    <br/>

    [Discord is also working on clips,](https://twitter.com/DiscordPreviews/status/1595169027097301046)
    which will be directly competing with Medal, a service made
    by the same people from Top.gg. So not only are they trying to
    kill bot listing sites, which is where Medal gets the majority if
    not all of its income, but they will be actively wiping this
    team off the planet with clips.

    <br/>

    Discord is also working on Client Themes for Nitro, which will
    be replacing a core feature in client mods like BetterDiscord.
    Which, speaking of which:

    <br/>

    * Client Mods and Custom Clients are constantly threatened

    BetterDiscord, along with other clients (like Ripcord, Vencord,
    Aliucord, Shelter, and more) are against Discord's ToS. This is
    because they have the ability to run client-side scripts, which
    allow you to abuse Discord's API and see usually private
    information, like Experiments, hidden channels, and a user's
    client. This always perplexed me since this is also possible
    in normal clients. Like I said, they're basically just browsers,
    so if you knew how to do it, you can run scripts on a normal
    client.

    <br/>

    Themes are a main feature of these mods as well, and this is also
    possible with the [Stylus extension.](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
    But for some reason, some people REALLY hate those who use these.
    I've seen multiple people (including myself) get banned for
    just sharing a screenshot with a custom theme. Keep in mind,
    this is possible in browsers and does not immediately indicate
    that someone is using a modded client. In fact, Opera GX has
    made custom themes for Discord, with full permission from them.

    <br/>

    And Discord hasn't forgotten about them. As of writing, they're
    now rolling out a selection of themes for Nitro users. This is
    a worrying change - if this was a feature available for everyone,
    it would be fine and a great inclusion. But they chose to paywall
    it, which could result in custom clients getting taken down and its
    users getting permbanned. They have never done these before, but
    this is the first time this is really possible.

    <br/>

    And it's a shame - these clients offer tons of quality of life
    features that Discord hasn't added in its 7 year existance. There's
    also a few lightweight clients, like Ripcord and Swiftcord, that
    are completely native. If they get taken down, I'm sure tons
    of users would not be able to use the platform anymore.

<section>
    Okay, okay, I'll stop there. I could honestly go on and on about
    Discord, but this is an incredibly overdue article and I have a
    lot more to go through.

    <br/>

    Originally, I was going to talk about a bunch of other platforms,
    such as Revolt and Matrix. This was before I got caught up and
    the post became over a month late. So instead of delaying it
    anymore, this will be a two parter. In the next part, I will be
    going through each of these platforms, discussing its positives
    and negatives, and finally ranking them.

    <br/>

    Again, if you're interested in seeing it early, [make sure to check
    the dev branch every now and then.](https://github.com/ggtylerr/ggtyler.dev/tree/dev)
    If you'd rather not read unfinished stuff, it ***should*** be
    out next week, if not, then in 2.

    <br/>

    Thank you for being patient and reading through this. I'll
    see you all soon™!

    <br/>
