    You might have seen this on the news about a year ago - a smart TV, 
    complete with 4K and HDR, and even a  unique soundbar. All for **free\***
    *(\*With a catch.)*
    <br/>
    [Telly,](https://www.telly.com/) made by the same folks who made [Pluto](https://pluto.tv/)
    (a free streaming service), is a TV meant to be "the biggest thing to
    happen to TV since color." Like many tech startups, it claims to be the
    future - the soundbar included has a screen itself, displaying somewhat
    useful information, such as the time, weather, so on. However, the main 
    star of the show is the price tag - for $0.00, you get the 55" model
    for free.
    <br/>
    But of course, nothing is free, and there's a catch - you have to allow
    ads on the soundbar screen, and more importantly, **allow your personal
    data to be sold.**
</section>
<section>
    Now, I want to make this abundantly clear - *I do not have a Telly myself.*
    I considered getting one when it was first announced back in mid 2023,
    but decided against it since I already have a TV and didn't want one so
    intrusive. That isn't the topic of this article, and why I'm making one
    without having the product itself. This is not about the quality or features
    of it, for that you can go to another site. This is about the limits of
    a user's consent - how much are you willing to give away for a service?
    At what point does it become too much, regardless of price? Are you willing
    to trade your privacy for convenience, and is the regular person willing to?
</section>
<section>
    Let's first get into the details. The TV tracks a couple things - it has
    a camera and microphone in the TV and soundbar. You have to keep these plugged
    in, or else it would be a violation of their TOS. That alone is quite
    concerning, but isn't *too* far from what's already done on smartphones. (The
    difference being it doesn't track you 24/7 and you can disable both with
    no worries.) It's also worth noting that the camera is only used at certain points,
    mainly for Zoom calls, and is covered by a shutter when it's not in use.
    <br/>
    The main thing that would be tracking you would be (what I assume) is the usual -
    any services you watch via the SmartTV OS, stuff based around your location, etc.
    It should be noted that I'm not 100% sure if you can even install regular
    streaming apps on here - I've seen conflicting reports on whether you can only use
    the pre-installed apps (Spotify, Zoom, etc.) or if you can install more, such as
    Netflix. In either case, you're still allowed to use any HDMI device, so you
    can easily use an Android TV stick with no worries of the TV tracking you.

    The main crutch, of course, is the dreaded advertisements. It seems they're
    restricted to only being on the soundbar screen. You *can* turn this screen off, 
    but not when you're watching something (you can only dim it in that case.) 
    Some articles say they "weren't nearly as intrusive as I thought they would be" 
    [(source)](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/i-tested-the-free-tv-that-got-the-internet-buzzing-and-it-was-far-better-than-expected/)
    or they're straight up scams:

    [(source)](https://lr.ggtyler.dev/r/TellyTV/comments/18its2d/turned_on_the_tv_to_reset_it_before_the_exchange/)
    <br/>
    You *can* report ads, but it seems it's a very similar case with how 
    YouTube/Google ads are treated. I wouldn't be surprised if more "sus" ads
    start showing up, like the fake mobile game ads and such.
    <br/>
    It's also worth mentioning that after nearly a half year since the
    first models arrived, a way to block these ads has not surfaced. Even
    if one were to be found, it's likely Telly would actively target these
    units and shut them down. After all, it is how they make their money back,
    and it is explicitly stated in their ToS.
</section>
<section>
    With all this in mind, let's get back to the main topic. Knowing all this,
    or at the very least the synopsis (a free TV + soundbar with ads and data
    tracking,) would the average person get it? Well, I went to go find out.
    <br/>
    I interviewed 12 completely random people IRL. Some from work, some
    strangers. Young, old, tech savvy or not. I asked each one of them the following:
    <blockquote>
        Do you know what the Telly TV is? It's a 55" TV, has 4K, HDR, and
        even has a soundbar with a screen. But there's a catch - you have
        to allow ads to show on it, and it will track some of your data.
        Knowing this, would you get it?
    </blockquote>
    *It's worth noting that only 1 person knew what it was beforehand.*
    <br/>
    What I got was interesting - a perfect 50/50 split. I was expecting it
    to be all one or the other, but it seems people are split on it. Some
    cases say it's situational or would only get it under a trial period.
    A few wouldn't get it period due to the ads alone. And others simply
    decided it's too good of a deal to pass up on.
    <br/>
    Now, it goes without saying - ***this is a very small sample size.***
    In normal cases, I'd have done a poll, either here or online somewhere.
    However, I wanted to survey the *average* person. Running a poll on here
    would have people favor not getting it (obviously due to privacy)
    and doing it online would only guage more tech savvy individuals.
    <br/>
    There are some other data points though - the founder stated last
    year that "250,000 people registered within the first two weeks of 
    launch" [(source)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/telly-free-smart-tv-250000-sign-ups/)
    and planned to ship at least 500k in the first year. Telly was 
    popularized in the media (most notably The Verge) but
    not *that* much. The subreddit r/TellyTV has less than 900
    members at the time of writing, and the Android companion app only
    has 50k downloads. So either the 250k was a lie for marketing reasons,
    or a lot of people decided against it later on.
    <br/>
    Where does that leave us with? A very big **maybe** on that question,
    and I think it's leaning towards not registering.
    If the user is desparate, chances are they'll get it (obviously), but
    most people are either only trying it, or deciding against it
    entirely.

<section>
    That's a good sign for now. A lot of people don't like having an annoying
    billboard in their house, and especially not one that's tracking
    what you're doing. But there is an underlying concern - most
    people only care about the ads themselves.
    <br/>
    For the average consumer, they would prefer not having to view them.
    But for their personal data? They either don't know, or don't care.
    In fact, some actively support collecting it. And this is where the
    industry will inevitably lead towards. The Telly may be trying to
    predict the future in its ad-supported structure, and it may or
    may not be right on that. We won't know about that for a long while.
    But it very well could be accurate on one prediction - in its
    privacy, or lack thereof. And that, for better or worse, is what
    it's truly impacting in the tech industry.
