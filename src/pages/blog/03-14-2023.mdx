    Hi there!

    Sorry for being slow on this post and updates in general.
    I've been feeling pretty depressed lately and have been
    dealing with work and future plans. Not to mention I was
    sick for a few days from food poisoning. To make up for this, 
    this post is much longer. I've also been doing commits on
    the [dev branch of the repo.](https://github.com/ggtylerr/ggtyler.dev/tree/dev)
    If you want to see it (along with rough drafts of posts), 
    it's public on [dev.ggtyler.dev](https://dev.ggtyler.dev)

    Site Updates:
    * Brand Kit fully completed
    * Credits page added
    * Astro updated to v2
      - Also updated all dependencies
    * Make Theme Switcher follow Backslash design standard
    * Proper description on 02/12/2023
    * Various minor style changes

    When you think of chat apps, what's the first one that
    comes to mind? Probably Discord. Maybe Skype, MS Teams,
    Slack, or TeamSpeak, depending on where you come from.
    Maybe even Revolt, Matrix, or IRC, if you're more into
    tech.

    <br/>

    But which one is best? And better yet, why is there so
    many of them?!

    <br/>
    
    ...Capitalism. That's why. Okay, bye!

    Okay, but seriously, which one is best? Obviously
    there's differences between all of them that better
    suits other kinds of people, such as business and
    gaming, but objectively speaking, what's the king of
    chat apps?

    <br/>

    Well, based on popularity, it's probably Discord.
    *(Really it's WhatsApp or maybe WeChat but we aren't 
    counting strictly text apps.)*

    Discord is great. I've been a user since Jan 2016,
    about 7 months after it was made public. It has an
    intuitive yet accessible UI, has tons of features,
    especially if you use BetterDiscord, and is used
    by pretty much every tech / game / internet related
    community. I love it.

    <br/>

    Unfortunately, Discord is far from perfect. Under
    the hood, Discord is kind of a nightmare. All of
    their current clients are made in React, a UI
    framework for HTML/CSS/JS. Non-web clients are
    made in Electron or React Native.

        The problem with React
        (and web-based Desktop frameworks)
    </h4>
    <hr/>

    React isn't *exactly* bad. This site uses a little
    bit of it, and for websites, it's perfectly fine. 
    Although, nowadays, it'd be best to either use Astro 
    (to be able to use other frameworks and for 
    client-side performance and loading), or to use a
    more performant and reliable framework, like Vue,
    Svelte, or Solid.

    <br/>
    
    But for desktop and mobile, web-based apps are a
    worringly common practice nowadays that
    significantly hurts system resources. If you thought
    Chrome was a RAM hog, try and imagine every single
    app you use running a completely separate instance
    of Chrome. That's essentially what the industry is
    currently heading, and Discord is one of the major
    apps doing this.

    <br/>
    
    If you're new to programming, or you or your
    company doesn't have enough resources, it's
    perfectly fine to do this. Making a new, separate
    program can be difficult and time-consuming,
    especially for Desktops. The problem is, Discord
    is definitely not a new company, and they certainly
    have more than enough resources. In fact, they HAD
    a native version at one point - the Android app
    was completely native, and worked perfectly fine,
    if only a little late on updates. But ~7 months ago,
    they switched to React Native for that platform as
    well. [They even made a press release for it.](https://discord.com/blog/android-react-native-framework-update)

    <br/>
    
    This is, by far, the worst update they have done.
    The new version is far more buggy, laggy, and
    overall worse than the previous version. If you
    are using an Android device, I strongly encourage
    you to either rollback the app, or to use [Aliucord.](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord)

    <br/>

    What I still don't understand to this day is why
    they went with this, especially when they have
    enough resources to make [entire party games and
    a framework specifically for handling them.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)
    Obviously it's behind Nitro, but still. Speaking
    of which...
