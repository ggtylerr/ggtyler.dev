    It was yet another day at high school - I was packing up after a long
    and boring day of classes, heading over to the one part of school that
    I actually liked. It was a small club, consisting of myself, two of
    my friends from middle school *(one who I still talk to,)* and a
    teacher. Our ultimate goal was to make a robot to compete in the
    yearly competition. It...wasn't going so well.
    <br/>
    With only three members, previously four before one left, and only
    one person actually doing the work, our progress was insanely slow.
    We had just barely made a framework at the time and was very clearly
    not gonna make a working robot by the deadline. But today was a little
    different - we were gonna move on to learning Python 2.
</section>
<section>
    None of us have learned programming before and it seemed like a big task.
    But as you could've guessed, I ended up really liking it. Over the next
    week, I made a few test scripts and small games, before finally releasing
    my first project: [KAaNE,](https://github.com/ggtylerr/KAaNE) or 
    "Keep Assisting and Nobody Explodes." This was meant as a companion program
    for the game [KTaNE,](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) "Keep Talking and Nobody 
    Explodes," which is primarily a multiplayer only game. The goal was to allow
    anyone to play it alone.
    <br/>
    Of course, other apps have already existed prior to this point and can be
    considered a cheating software to some. But to me, in early 2018? I saw it as
    a really good way to learn how to develop something, while also being able to
    cater to a certain niche. I was even able to add some functionality still not
    seen in other apps (sometimes called "solvers") - pretty much all of them
    only supported the native game, where as mine also included a handful of
    modded solvers.
    <br/>
    This was my first script, and with that, mistakes were made. The entirety of
    the project is mostly one Python script, which was incredibly bloated and poorly
    written. Plus, it's plastered with my old username. *(Yes, that's what "gg"
    stood for initially.)* But overtime I iterated upon it with new versions, such
    as [a GUI version made in Java,](https://github.com/ggtylerr/KAaNE-JE-)
    [a version made for Android,](https://github.com/ggtylerr/KAaNE-AE-)
    one that was made in Qt that never got released, and a few others.
    <br/>
    I also made a lot of other projects and drafts, most of which never saw the
    public light. One of which is this site, initially released on December 10th,
    2019. *(...okay, it hasn't been five years since then, and over five years since my
    first program, but it's close enough.)*
</section>
<section>
    Over time though, I gradually lost free time and motivation. I simply couldn't
    open my IDE for the longest time, and I eventually got a job and tried university.
    In the back of my mind, I always wondered: "Is coding even my thing? Would anyone
    even care for what I make?" Those questions have been engrained in my mind for a long
    time now, and roughly two years ago, I wanted to see if *anyone* would care for
    what I do.
    <br/>
    So, back in December of 2022, I started hosting Invidious. At the time, I was using
    a dedicated server shared amongst two other people. Just like with Python 4 years
    prior, I was going into sysadmin mostly blind. I had no idea what I was doing
    most of the time. Whenever a problem happened, I begged the main admin, moocow,
    to help me out.
    <br/>
    8 months later, I moved out of their server and into one I rented entirely on my own.
    In fact, I set up three - one in New York, Seattle, and Paris. I set up more
    frontends, changed around the servers, set up more scripts and configs, and...
</section>
<section>
    Now, we're in the present. Well, nearly there, we're about a month away.
    <br/>
    Invidious was down for a few months - Google put in their latest blocks to
    deter any scraping from (most likely) AI models, and subsequently blocked
    most third-party services. But Invidious was just gearing up to workaround these,
    and as someone who was keeping a close eye on the situation, I implemented the
    patch as soon as I was able to.
    <br/>
    When it fully released, they decided to remove any public instance that hasn't
    updated it yet, and that left mine to be one of the only ones available. Not only
    that, it was the one of two that was primarily hosted in the US, and the fourth on
    the list.
    <br/>
    ...and now we're in the present! Needless to say, we got a lot of users from that. 
    At the time of writing, there are now [4000 users,](https://iv.ggtyler.dev/api/v1/stats) 
    900 of which have been active the past month. It even managed to get into LTT's now 
    deleted de-google video, as Invidious was present and the instance was listed in it. 
    (Thanks, Linus!)
    <br/>
    4000 might not seem like a lot to some people - of course, that's the amount of
    registered users, and I have how many are actively on the instance. *(I don't use
    any kind of analytics.)* But to me, it finally served as an answer to that question.
    *People finally care.*
    <br/>
    If you can't tell, I'm not exactly a prolific developer or master hacker. I'm a guy
    working shit wages, trying to make a name for himself by hosting privacy friendly 
    services. And while I've been happy just hosting them for myself for the past few years,
    knowing that there are people out there who use them too? Who actually benefitted
    from it? It's a nice feeling, and I can't really thank you all enough.
    <br/>
    So as a little thank you, I'm publishing...well, a lot of things.
</section>
<section>
    As you no doubt can already tell, the entire website got a new design. The previous one,
    while nice in some areas, lacked the overall theme that I wanted to use, which were backslashes.
    For those that don't know, a backslash character, `\`, is used in programming
    to ["escape" a character.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) It seemed
    fitting to use, as I wanted it to stand out, to "escape" amongst the crowd. Now
    with this new design, I feel like it really does do that now.
    <br/>
    I can't take credit for it alone, as the bulk of it was sketched by 
    [Shaheer Babar,](https://www.behance.net/shaheerchoudhe) a UI designer who
    specializes in these kinds of sleek designs. I of course did the coding, made tweaks,
    additions, and so on, but still. I highly recommend his work if you need a designer.
    <br/>
    Along with the sleek new looks, I've officially published the internal server configs
    and scripts for the frontends under [project "GLOBE".](https://www.github.com/ggtylerr/globe)
    This is intended as a way to validate the services I host, while also allowing
    the community to make any changes. This is also a way for *anyone* to host their own,
    so no need to rely on mine anymore. Self-hosting 15 frontends is now as simple as cloning
    the repo, running a script, and adding a lot of DNS records. *(...I'll be fixing `init.sh`
    to not need that over the following week.)*
    <br/>
    And speaking of frontends, this is a little bit old now, but I've started a proof of concept
    for a YouTube frontend made in Astro, called [AstroTube.](https://www.github.com/ggtylerr/astrotube)
    This uses the Invidious API as a backend and is meant to be as performant and lightweight as
    possible. In fact, here's a video of it running [on my New 3DS XL.](https://iv.ggtyler.dev/watch?v=FKY8s_4wL2M) 
    *(Yes, not very old, but not even Invidious runs on it.)*
    <br/>
    Besides that, I've also finally [migrated to Mastodon,](https://layer8.space/@ggtyler)
    and there is now a [Discord and Matrix chat room.](/social) And while I couldn't get a prototype 
    out in time for this post, I'm also planning on making a native client for YouTube, Invidious, Piped,
    and more on desktop. Stay tuned for that.

    I know it isn't terribly much, but I'm now fully dedicated to working on this again. I've
    had a lot of trouble over the past few years, but it starting to seem like I'm finally able
    to have something in this life. I can't forsee the future, Invidious and other frontends
    will certainly die down overtime or get patched, but... regardless of what will happen, all I can
    say is this: Thank you. Truthfully.
    <br/>
    By using any of the frontends I've hosted, and hell, reading this post and any others,
    I'm able to get just that little bit of motivation back. The same kind I thought died out. Over
    the past week alone, I've been working non-stop on all of the above, and while I was definitely
    stressed out at times... it felt good finally working on something I know people will like and use.
    <br/>
    üç∫ So here's to roughly 5 years of this site, and roughly many more!
