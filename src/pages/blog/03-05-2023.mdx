    Hi there!

    Sorry for being slow on this post and updates in general.
    I've been feeling pretty depressed lately and have been
    dealing with work and future plans. To make up for this,
    this post is much longer. The next post will be out next
    week, like normal.

    Site Updates:
    * Brand Kit fully completed
    * Credits page added
    * Proper description on 02/12/2023

    When you think of chat apps, what's the first one that
    comes to mind? Probably Discord. Maybe Skype, MS Teams,
    Slack, or TeamSpeak, depending on where you come from.
    Maybe even Revolt, Matrix, or IRC, if you're more into
    tech.

    But which one is best? And better yet, why is there so
    many of them?!
