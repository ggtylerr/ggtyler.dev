    <h3 class="text-2xl">Brief Rundown</h3>
    <hr/>
    If you only know me through these blog posts 
    (which, jesus christ, really? 
    Join the discord or hop on a stream some time, 
    cause that's probably really boring), 
    you probably didn't hear about my break. 
    Essentially, I needed to take some time off of work and streams. 
    But really, it was a culmination of multiple events leading up 
    to it - from an esports org I've been with for over a year, 
    basically going down in a few weeks, to my rapidly deteriorating 
    mental health, I absolutely needed to take my mind off. 
    And that's exactly what I did, from May 3rd to last week 
    (nearly a month.) I didn't relax for 3 weeks straight, though, 
    I had my mind focus on a lot of stuff, so really it's 
    less like a "vacation break" and more so a "break because 
    of other things happening."

    <br/>

    Okay, enough rambling, I'm supposed to give a rundown, lol. 
    Basically I was screwed for a couple months and I needed to 
    take that break. But what actually happened? I didn't 
    share too much details about it back then, so why not do it now? 
    Why not add in a couple of extra stuff too that I might as 
    well update you guys on?

    <br/>

    Well, that's why I'm making this post. And it's a long one. 
    I already said that at the start and I don't know how to 
    segue this... Screw it, let's just jump right into it.

<section id="sse">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">Silver State Esports</h3>
    <hr/>
    Picture this: you've recently joined a club or membership 
    for your favorite hobby. You also find out that there's an 
    organization that massively helps run it, but you can tell it 
    has a million different flaws and that you can fix at least 
    some of them. You can either leave it alone and just don't 
    bother with it (after all, it *is* a hobby), or you can help 
    kickstart your own career, somewhat loosely tied to your hobby. 
    If it's not obvious, I chose the latter.

<section id="founding">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">The Founding and my time in SSE</h3>
    <hr/>
    I found out about SSE somewhere around late October, 2019, and 
    they've been in operation since at least the start of August of 
    that year. It was founded by a teen named Davis Kong, along with 
    a couple of his friends - Scisto, Angie, Billy, and probably a 
    couple more that I don't know about. They started small, mainly 
    having roots from UNLV's own esports team. But over time, it 
    grew to be partnered with not only every HS in Clark County, 
    but also multiple other organizations and companies. Off the 
    top of my head, there's Skullz Inc that does merchandise, LVL 
    Up Expo, which is a major gaming convention locally and a major 
    helper for SSE and esports here in general, Gameworks for 
    occasional tourneys, HyperX for minor involvement in their 
    Esports Arena here, AVGL, which does...something... and probably 
    a lot more that I don't know or forgot about. They even list 
    Microsoft as a partner on their website, but I've never actually 
    seen anything involving them, so take that with a grain of salt.

    <br/>

    When I found them, SSE was technologically bankrupt in my eyes - 
    they used (and still uses) Wix for their website, and barely has 
    any software developers or technowizards on their staff. 
    I reached out to Davis about this, mainly about their website, 
    since you *really* don't want to be partnered with one of 
    the biggest tech companies in the world and use *Wix* for 
    your website.

    <br/>

    He explained that the current devs have already coded a site in 
    plain HTML (just like the one you're on right now) and they 
    needed stuff "hella quick" (sic) in order to update their 
    calendars and PR (or player scores.) At the time, I didn't know 
    much about WordPress or other potential solutions, so I shrugged 
    it off and said Wix was probably the best, at least for now. 
    And looking back at the chat logs to jog my memory, he basically 
    gave me admin access and added me near instantly because I was 
    the only other person who knows how to code there. 
    *BTW, this was back when KAaNE was actively getting updated and I 
    didn't know what express was. Yikes.*

    <br/>

    Over time, I got to know the staff, both personally and over 
    Discord, which was their main platform for communication and the 
    community. I later realized just how bad they needed me - they 
    had someone way more skilled than I am (even now), who was there 
    since the beginning. That person was Billy. Just checking their 
    'GitHub (which is not linked due to privacy concerns), they had 
    code for assembly and various complex apps, set up the server 
    and 2 websites nearly by himself, and even a god damn home 
    server. So, how is that an issue?

    <br/>

    It was nearly a one man department for a whole organization. 
    You think TF2 has it bad with 4-12 people on their team? 
    Try having one or two people handling nearly everything 
    related to tech in an org. That might not sound bad, especially 
    since the biggest concern was a website that barely anyone knows 
    about or uses, but it also handles one other thing - their 
    Minecraft server.

    <br/>

    If you were in the "Factions" or teams event last year, you'll 
    recall how much of a terrible experience it was. Included with 
    multiple allegations against me (since I was an admin and 
    participating), there was also the fact that the server was 
    set up by two people pretty quickly - Billy and snakeye. 
    (I think snakeye did. Don't quote me on that though.) For the 
    past few months, it had little to no traffic, usually having 
    5 people online at most. On the first hour, there was about 
    30-40 people. I can't comment on what happened behind the scenes 
    since, unlike what some have said, I did barely any admin work at 
    that time. What I can say, though, is that there was a lot of 
    pressure put on to the staff, and they were probably incredibly 
    panicked, since nearly none of the server issues would be solved 
    (including after the event.)

    <br/>

    SSE commonly stated that these issues would be fixed in the future, 
    and that a new event would happen soon. If you knew about the 
    event, you probably know of the outcome of this too. A new event 
    has always been planned, but whether due to declining interest or 
    from upcoming events, it permanently stalled. Billy, the previous 
    server owner and only other real developer, left due to finding a 
    more sustainable but demanding job, and I was left as the only 
    proper dev in the org. (To clarify, there was another person that 
    supposedly knew coding, but I've never actually seen them do it 
    or help me during my time on SSE.)

    <br/>

    At that time, I've already done substantial work on other projects 
    to help the org, like DSA Bot or the now defunct Wordpress rework 
    website. And to try and help SSE as a dev, I restructured the 
    discord server to be updated with newer (and more helpful) 
    additions/features, and have also taken over as the owner of the 
    Minecraft server. In fairness, I didn't do much over the entire 
    course, but I did do a couple things. I had to move the server 
    due to an overdue bill from the host (twice), pay some of those 
    fees out of pocket, fix multiple issues including resetting every 
    permission due to the move, and even temporarily ran the server 
    on my desktop for public use. Which made my IP public for a small 
    amount of time. I was promoted to a supervisor shortly after 
    Billy left, and I helped as much as I could in that aspect, too. 
    But nothing could have predicted what happened next.

<section id="situation">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">The "Situation"</h3>
    <hr/>
    Near the start of the year, Scisto, an original founder, 
    was fired from the organization. The proper resignation was 
    never made publicly (at least, from my knowledge and what I 
    recall), as the reason was never given. It was soon revealed 
    around late March that the main reason was...emotional at best. 
    Angie, Davis' girlfriend, revealed that she was in an abusive 
    relationship with Davis for some time, and after Scisto had 
    tried to help Angie out of it, Davis quickly fired him. This 
    was all revealed in probably the best way possible - 
    <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srkq41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a TwitLonger.</a> 
    Soon after, two more notable ones where made, 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/mscisto/status/1375269808892125185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one by Scisto,</a> 
    and 
    <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srkqj4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one by Davis.</a> 
    There was also 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gqqrprLclNXs26TmeszFVZYNlMLliiQVnwBOhz_kTLQ/edit?ouid=115298995853646888626&usp=docs_home&ths=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a google doc later made by Davis</a> 
    (and multiple other people suggesting edits to him), but it is 
    commonly barraded on as being 
    <a href="https://i.vgy.me/m6M3UH.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nitpicking and biased.</a> 
    (<a href="https://i.vgy.me/3lWoat.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also</a>, 
    <a href="https://i.vgy.me/NwpGMu.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lol</a>.)

    <br/>

    As for my stance on this whole thing, I initally coughed it up to 
    petty Twitter drama (since...y'know, Twitlonger.) Over time, 
    though, I quickly grew to support Scisto's side. And despite 
    the bad evidence shown here, privately, I've gotten enough 
    evidence on my own to decide that Scisto is telling the truth. 
    Whatever the case, it's been months after it's happened and both 
    have somewhat moved on at this point. So where do I play in to 
    all this?

    <br/>

    Well, either on purpose or by sheer luck, a major event was 
    happening just a day after the whole thing started. The usual 
    event organizer, Coolkidd, was moving to a new house and needed 
    other people to handle the event instead. Having the proper 
    streaming equipment, and being a supervisor, I offered to help. 
    So, on Saturday, I was meant to stream that day's events with 
    all the proper software needed. On Thursday, I was setting up 
    all the necessary software and scenes (it turns out event 
    organizers *really* like their custom software.) On one 
    test, N0te (the other person that was going to stream), mentioned 
    something about Angie's posts and it affecting the event and SSE 
    as a whole. I didn't know about it at that time, and coughed it 
    up as drama that will subside over the coming weeks. This was 
    mere hours before Davis made his own post, on 11 PM, and took 
    all of the drama over to their main platform.

    <br/>

    Sadly, due to the late hours it happened in, and my constantly 
    shifting sleep schedule, I didn't get to see it happen live. 
    My impressions, though, is that the entire org was basically 
    on fire right now, and we needed to fight it through the event. 
    And in retrospect, it somewhat worked - SSE as a whole was saved, 
    but did little to pick a side between the two. Honestly, though, 
    it was a miracle we even had an event to begin with.

    <br/>

    It was half a day after the fires broke out, and even then, many 
    have already left. I don't know how many were gone, but I do 
    remember we had about 2-3 people left for casting, with one of 
    them basically casting throughout the entire event. On my own 
    stream, I had multiple issues, some simply from my hardware - 
    the CPU had a horrible stock fan, with temperatures commonly 
    reaching up to ~150-180°F, which meant that it both throttled 
    constantly and was lowering its lifespan. To combat this, I 
    set my AC to cool about 24 hours before the livestream. This 
    resulted in having my entire house at a freezing 45°F (which in 
    vegas is about 30°F lower than the average temperature outside), 
    which not only meant I was absolutely cold, everyone else inside 
    it was as well. The best part was it did little to help, as it 
    turned out the CPU would still freeze for no discernable reason. 

    <br/>

    In the end, the event happened to be the last one SSE did (at 
    least as of writing), and while it wasn't great, it definitely 
    helped a bit. Also, apparently it was lengthened and I was 
    supposed to stream for their 4th day (woops sorry guys lol.) 
    But as it turns out, that wasn't the end of what I had to do.
</section>
<section id="aftermath">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">The Aftermath</h3>
    <hr/>
    By the end of that event, there was only 3 supervisors - me, 
    Coolkidd, and N0te. There was also Davis and Naya, one of which 
    doesn't count cause they're the main source of the problem, the 
    other is someone that was unable to interact with anyone outside 
    of a couple people for months. N0te had the idea to make a 
    "committee" of sorts, having them deal with all management in the 
    organization. I thought it was a good idea as it would both solve 
    the current problem and prevent future ones, so I was on board 
    with the plan.

    <br/>

    We (well, mainly me and n0te) quickly set up a server for the 
    various members to use, and we held a "mini-meeting" of sorts to 
    both introduce everyone and quickly talk about certain issues. As 
    with every meeting, I recorded it, but it contains some information 
    that still pertains to me that I would rather not have the 
    general public know about. (Plus, I don't want Davis to know 
    about it, lol.) Basically, we talked about everything but what 
    would happen to Davis - we mainly talked about a potential future 
    for SSE.

    <br/>

    The day after, 
    <a href="https://i.vgy.me/KarWYK.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> 
    <a href="https://i.vgy.me/A9u1lp.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was made.</a> 
    If you can't already tell, there was some details that I (along 
    with nearly everyone else) was not informed about, especially 
    the part where it was *specifically made to be against Davis.* 
    This post was later removed to save face.

    <br/>

    A day (or a couple days) later, Davis sent n0te an email, stating 
    multiple things from SSE's bylaws and threatened legal action. 
    You probably shouldn't trust my words since I'm no means a legal 
    expert, but jesus christ are the bylaws horrible. They basically 
    don't allow removal of board members (one level higher than 
    supervisors) unless they're removed by another board member. 
    There was two members - Davis and Naya. Since Naya wouldn't be 
    able to do anything for months, Davis was essentially 
    safeguarded. If you want to see the bylaws for yourself, 
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eom_Mm1n7aNRbWn2fjYWgJ0Ca3gRk_t6/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here you go.</a>

    <br/>

    So, there was pretty much nothing we could do. I disbanded the 
    committee, and either shortly before or after that, Davis 
    announced his own changes with the remaining staff members. As 
    I'm not on NDA, I'm 
    <a href="https://i.vgy.me/5VmVfY.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free to publicly give this</a> 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3Qj8s0cKrnno6LyNOb3cUa6-DrvpCVgONkfT2lK86U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information to the public.</a> 
    And, if it isn't obvious already, I left SSE, as I was no longer 
    needed and I did not want to involve myself with them anymore.

    <br/>

    As for what happened afterwards? Well, I'm not really sure for 
    SSE. Even in my last days there, I was not in the know of their 
    activity, since I technically was still deciding whether or not 
    to leave. In reality, I was waiting for a couple stuff to happen 
    before I left - a future job, and "severance pay" of sorts. (Just 
    a week or so before this happened, merch came out for supervisors 
    to use. I wanted to get one 'cause why not.) I would never get 
    the severance pay, but I did get that job rather quickly - 
    something I'll briefly talk about later.

    <br/>

    As for the community, well, it's been pretty much dead for a 
    while. There has been some activity every once in a while (it 
    does have ~400 members), but overall, it's been stagnant. I don't 
    really know about other events, but for SSE, there has not been 
    anything happening since the one I was in. As for me, I was done 
    with SSE, but I was not done with mental stress - I was far from 
    that.

<section id="school">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">School ~~nightmares~~ problems</h3>
    <hr/>
    This section was originally going to be pretty long, but I 
    realize this is already a novel, so I'm going to make this bit 
    fast. This all happened at the start of my final quarter and 
    ended nearly 3 weeks before final exams. Imagine trying to fit 
    about 3 months of work in about 3 weeks. That has been what I 
    had to deal with for the past month. Luckily, I did manage to 
    graduate and I no longer have to deal with them, so let's move 
    on from this.
</section>
<section id="future">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">Future (and near future) projects</h3>
    <hr/>
    Now that I'm done with school and SSE, what's next? Well, I'm 
    heading to university. That might sound bad with my already 
    slow progress, but don't worry, I've been told it's pretty 
    leniant. If you want to look it up, I'm attending Full Sail 
    University's online classes for August 2021. I'll be done 
    sometime between late 2023 and early 2024.

    <br/>

    As for esports, I'm still in their community. I'm just not with 
    SSE anymore. In fact, I'm already in a different org, I'm just 
    not allowed to say which one just yet. (They currently aren't 
    public.) What I can say, though, is that it's going to be big. 
    And we already have quite a bit of stuff set up.

    <br/>

    If you're a regular visitor of this site, though, you know that 
    isn't my main gig - what about software? Well, most of my 
    original projects are still underway, but I do have a couple 
    more stuff coming up.
</section>
<section id="mc">
    <h4 class="text-xl">MC Server (GGs)</h4>
    <hr/>
    As mentioned before, I was the server owner for the SSE 
    minecraft server. Now, while I did give them back the server 
    files, I was still paying a good chunk of it by myself and 
    legally owned it. I'm 99% sure that they won't be doing the 
    event anymore (or at least until the next year), so why not do 
    it myself?

    <br/>

    GGs is a minecraft server that is better than the original SSE 
    server in a number of ways - instead of just survival (and later 
    an anarchy mode that I added), there's now 3 modes. Survival, 
    Anarchy, and Creative. We're also on a Fabric server instead of 
    Paper, which means we're able to use 
    <a href="https://github.com/CaffeineMC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CaffeineMC's suite of optimization mods</a> 
    (some of which are 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fAB6pJK6U4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even better than OptiFine's optimizations.</a>)

    <br/>

    Sadly, Minecraft's 1.17 release is coming in a couple days. Since 
    we're trying to use the latest version, the server will not be 
    available until plugins are available on 1.17. Either that or I 
    just give up and just use 1.16 instead. Even without the release, 
    the server would take about a week for it to release. Even though 
    you could <i>technically</i> join and play just fine, there's 
    still a lot of problems that still need to be fixed.

<section id="ggt">
    <h4 class="text-xl">ggt.bz</h4>
    <hr/>
    While being bored, I found this domain at a surprisingly cheap 
    price. I've been thinking of making a URL shortener as well, so 
    hey, why not. The shortener itself is not done yet, but the 
    website and private custom URLs are set up. If you want to see 
    the website:

    <h4 class="text-xl">DSA Bot and KAaNE</h4>
    <hr/>
    DSA Bot and KAaNE will still exist, but both will be getting new 
    versions. I've already talked about KAaNE before, but basically, 
    there will be a final version made on C++ and parity updates will 
    be made on the Android version. Both will release by August. 
    If you don't even know what KAaNE is, let's move on. 

    <br/>

    DSA Bot was originally made for my esports club in DSA, hence the 
    name. It later spiraled into a full-time project and made for 
    both esports and general users. Because of that (and my departure 
    from that club and DSA as a whole), the project will be getting a 
    rebranding, moving to GPL3, and an actual proper team by the end 
    of June. Before that, though, the final update will be made - 
    music. I promised it a long time ago since repl.it started 
    supporting it, so hey, might as well. I'll also be fixing any 
    remaining bugs that I can.

    <br/>

    If you're worried about DSA Bot, don't worry - the repo will 
    still be available under public domain, as originally intended. 
    The bot itself will go down, but users are still able to run 
    their own versions and make any changes they want to.

<section id="whoknows">
    <h4 class="text-xl">???</h4>
    <hr/>
    There are also a ton of hidden projects that I'm being involved 
    in - some of which will be available in the near future, others 
    will be in a few years time. I know I've made big promises 
    before, but trust me, this time I'm serious. As for what I can 
    say about them? Two characters. D and H.

<section id="end">
    <h3 class="text-2xl">Conclusion and TL;DR</h3>
    <hr/>
    For the past couple of months, I've been in a mental limbo and 
    went through a lot of shit. And I won't lie to you, I'm still 
    kind of in one. It's getting better, though, and there's a lot of 
    good stuff coming out soon. Speaking of mental limbo, I don't 
    really know how to make this conclusion. Yeah, I'm not the best 
    writer, lol.

    <br/>

    Well, here's your TL;DR: I was a part of SSE cause they needed 
    help, the founder did several idiotic moves, and I left after 
    dealing with the aftermath. I also had to deal with my school, 
    and I have several projects that'll come out soon.

    <br/>

    ...anddd that's about it. I'll start streaming again next week, 
    so if you want to say hi, feel free to check it out. As for
