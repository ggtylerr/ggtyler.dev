    Hey there! Welcome to the first biweekly post. This is going to
    turn the blog into an update / general tech/code blog (instead 
    of posting once every few months or more.) So before we get into
    the topic, here's some general site updates:
    * Port all old posts to MD / MDX format and add them
    * Add resume and started on misc. page
    * Fix rss.xml not properly working
    * Small stylistic change to blog list

    Along with this, I've also started hosting open-source frontends,
    starting with Invidious. My main instance 
    [*(iv.ggtyler.dev)*](https://iv.ggtyler.dev) went public on the
    6th, and since then, 50 users have registered. (Keep in mind
    most people don't register.) I may host more in the future, so
    stay tuned. Also, if you're from one of those instances, thanks
    for checking this site out!

    Anyways, on to the main topic. If you've used any modern app,
    chances are, it's been made on JavaScript. Obviously there's
    browsers with websites and JS, but there's a multitude of desktop
    / mobile apps, such as Discord, Telegram, Steam, Skype, VSC, etc.

    If you're a regular user, you probably didn't even know. All you
    *might've* known is that these applications use a fair bit of
    memory:
    ![Screenshot showing Firefox using 2GB, Visual Studio Code using 
    1.3GB, Discord using 900MB, Steam using 500MB, and 
    Thunderbird using 300MB.](/blog/01122023-taskmgr.png)
    Combined, all of these apps use **5 GB**, over 30% of [a regular
    gaming system's RAM (16GB),](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) 
    and over half of an average PC's RAM (8GB)!

    Now, why is this the case? Well it's not like they want to
    purposely gimp your PC. I'm sure if most developers had the
    option, they would make it so it only takes up 10MB.

    But it's important to know that they may not have the option -
    in cases like Discord, they're working with an app that's been
    worked on for years. Throwing that all out to switch to a new
    framework or language is not only costly and a long process,
    but it has no real advantage besides performance.

    There may also be executive decisions. JavaScript is a great
    language (at least IMO) because it's much more straightforward
    than most. With C++, you're lacking all modern inclusions, and
    have to deal with headers and such. With Java, you have to deal 
    with multiple package managers, generics, and incredibly long names.
    With Python, non-versatility. With C#, Microsoft.

    With JS, the most you'll have to deal with is async functionality.
    After that, you can do just about anything and *easily.*
