    No major site updates this time - Going on vacation for
    [LVL Up Expo '23](https://lvlupexpo.com/) and because of that
    I've barely any time to work on this. So naturally, we should
    talk about AI!
</section>
<section>
    AI has been a hot topic in the tech industry for years now and 
    its impact on the world of programming is undeniable. Let's start 
    with OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot. Both are AI-powered 
    autocomplete tools that suggests code snippets to developers while they're 
    coding. These AI tools have revolutionized the way developers work by 
    making the coding process faster and more efficient. They can save hours 
    of coding time and reduce the chances of errors and bugs in the code.

    Next, we have Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2. These are AI-powered drawing 
    tools that allow artists and designers to create stunning artwork based on 
    natural language descriptions. They can draw anything from abstract patterns 
    to detailed illustrations and provide a new level of creativity and versatility 
    to the world of digital art. Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 are great examples of
    how AI can be used to enhance the creative process and produce unique and 
    beautiful artwork.

    ...If you noticed the writing style is different, that's cause I made
    ChatGPT write those two parts. It's mostly the same with 2 minor edits:

    ![A screenshot showing ChatGPT generating the above two sections](/res/blog/02122023-chatgpt.png)

    I've tried to make it more neutral and to follow my writing style,
    but unfortunately its much more knowledge oriented. So as you can see,
    it can definitely be helpful to start off. But what will this look like
    5, 10 years from now?
</section>
<section>
    We're at the point where AI can genuinely pass the Turing test. 
    [In fact, it already has.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/17/google-ai-lamda-turing-test/)
    *(In case you're stuck at the paywall, it can be bypassed by zapping 
    the elements in ublock origin.)* Of course it's a bit broken
    and subjective, but it's still a huge milestone for intelligence.
    It is now on par with the average human in terms of communication.
</section>
<section>
    The rate this grows will also be exponential. I previously thought
    (along with a lot of other people) that we were at least 20 years
    away from AI passing human intelligence. With AI at its current
    rate, I'd bet it would pass it *by* 2030, and possibly in 5 years.
    I hope I don't need to tell you how absolutely terrifying this is.
    We have about 5 years left until AI could take over. And this isn't
    unreasonable to think about - I wouldn't doubt it if cGPT has
    taken over a basic customer service role. It took about a year to get
    the current job I have now, mainly because the place I lived in
    (Vegas), had no entry-level jobs available besides ones needing
    a car. This could very quickly become the norm everywhere.
</section>
<section>
    So how do we deal with this? I'd say put it up with legislation,
    but that's a slow process, plus not everyone is able to do this.
    The next best option is to learn these and use them as tools.
    It's obviously not going to replace a lot of jobs now, so it's
    best to learn them while they're new. If you happen to run a
    business (very *very* slim chance but still) try to avoid outright
    replacing jobs (even though it could potentially cut costs.)
    [The UN has also put out an initiative to describe the ethics of AI.](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1106612)
    Whenever the Singularity happens or jobs start getting replaced
    en masse, hopefully they'll put out something too.

    ...I know my articles haven't been positive lately. I don't like
    having to talk about big issues like these for the past month.
    Issues that go far beyond what this blog is capable of. But I
    feel an obligation to do so. And in case you've been feeling
    down because of this, just remember that these aren't really
    big issues, at least right now. Remember that when you focus
    on the bad, the good gets obfuscated. There's still a lot of
    it out there in the world. Just keep your chin up and live for
    those moments.
