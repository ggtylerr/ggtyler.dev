    Note to self: do reports on the 31st so I don't make a report 
    on the funny haha day

    <br/>

    In case you don't know why I'm doing this: I recently made a 
    [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/ggtylerr) account and I stated in 
    [a previous post](https://www.ggtylerr.dev/blog/02-18-2021)
    that by the end of every quarter I'd post a transprency report on 
    listing where money earned will go.

    <br/>

    So far I've earned literally nothing from Ko-Fi (great start) and 
    the amount of money spent so far is $7 ($14 by tomorrow), only for
    paying repl.it.

    <br/>

    There *is*, however, a silver lining - I recently started 
    doing [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ggtylerr)
    regularly and had enough of a viewerbase to get Affiliate - and 
    that means I was able to get donations.

    <br/>

    And from Twitch donations - I was able to get **$48.67** in total. 
    There's a problem, though - 
    [you aren't able to payout until you get $100.](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/affiliate-payout-faq?language=en_US) 
    Plus, I'd rather not mix Twitch donations with Ko-Fi donations. 
    People would want to donate to Twitch streams to support that stream 
    and others would donate to Ko-Fi accounts to support people's creative works. 
    Mixing the two would probably not be the best.

    <br/>

    Now what? We're out of options...right? Well...

    <br/>

    ...apparently I have connections, and I've gotten gigs to do programming 
    for people for cash. I can't reveal anything regarding these 
    (I prefer to have this kind of stuff anonymous)

    <br/>

    So, from gigs, I've gotten $22. Not bad, and in total, we have $30 left 
    (after tomorrow) - which means we have until August 2nd until money runs out. 
    Plenty of time to get a part time job and earn money for the server! 

    <br/>

    Still, though, I would really appreciate it if we can get donations. 
    With them, not only would I be able to do cooler projects, but I'd 
    also be able to afford food and housing!

    <br/>

    In all seriousness, though, with donations I'd be able to do some really 
    cool stuff - and there's quite a bit that could be done. 

    <br/>

    Welp, thank you for reading this stuff. I know reading about apps and 
    services is more boring than actually using them. I *am* working 
    on everything - just a tad bit more busy than usual due to recent events. 
    See you guys in the next post!
