    For the past year, my old site, along with a lot of other projects, has been sitting in the dust.

    This was due to a combination of disinterest, laziness, and growing interest for new projects. Something I want to talk about in the future. But not now.

    This finally caught up to me when a few days ago my server backup, for whatever reason, *got completely wiped.* It is currently sitting at a cool 35 bytes.

    So allow me to introduce my newest project:

    Now, I will admit, this is only the start. The website is not done and the majority of pages lead to 404.

    I had to rush this out since the site needed to be up, even though I wanted to add a lot more at launch. But what can you do.

    Over the coming days and weeks, this site will be updated, and along with that, this blog will receive *weekly* posts.
    Either on updates to projects or whatever my mind's been on recently.
