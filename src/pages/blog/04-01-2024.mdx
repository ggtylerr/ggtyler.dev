<section>
  I'm happy to announce that, on the day of this blog post's release, our
  services are partnering with big tech to make our services even better!
  With companies like Google, Microsoft, ~~Meta~~ Facebook, ~~X~~ Twitter,
  Fandom, Cloudflare, Discord, Tencent, the CIA, and the KGB, we'll be evolving
  technology like never before.
  <br/>
  With the brand new SHIT™ (patent pending) technology, our websites load 0.00000000001
  seconds faster! We have also ported all our existing web software into PHP, and our
  future apps will now be made with Assembly and WinForms (no support for 32-bit, Mac,
  or Linux planned, but for mobile, we'll be exclusively supporting Windows Phones!) 
  Our future chat room will also be hosted exclusively on Facebook Messenger!

  We're also going to be updating our Terms of Conditions and Privacy Policy. Instead
  of respecting your privacy and treating you like a human being, we're going to
  be moving into the future and collect every scrap of data we possibly can. To further
  improve our services, of course. We have absolutely no plans to sell it or give it
  to the government, promise!
  <br/>
  To reflect these changes, we're going to be switching out our frontends to better
  and more quality services. Instead of Invidious, Piped, Beatbump, Hyperpipe, Cobalt,
  and Poke, we'll be replacing it with just one: OurTube™©. This revolutionary
  service, which is not at all a rebranded app that we just got off of a burner
  flip phone, you can experience YouTube like it was meant to be: constantly
  buffering videos in 144p. Oh, and with 50 unskippable ad breaks.
  <br/>
  YouTube isn't the only one! We're also going to be replacing RedLib with
  Google Usenet Groups, SearXNG and 4get with Bing and Ask Jeeves, and BreezeWiki
  with Fandom (but with even more ads and somehow even worse writing)

  Of course, even though they're Fortune 500 companies and have billions of dollars,
  we can't do this all for free. That's why we've been inspired by Adobe and JetBrains
  to implement our innovative pricing model! For an incredibly low fee of $199.99
  a month, you get access to all our services! (For 1 hour a day. Restrictions apply.)
  If that doesn't suit your needs, you can buy unlimited access to just one of our
  services. For one update, until we change our minds and revoke your license. Oh,
  and if you want a refund, you'll have to pay $499.99 for it.

  We hope that you enjoy our brand new services, and that you stay tuned for more! Because
  from here on out, April 1st is going to be a day known for innovating technology!
