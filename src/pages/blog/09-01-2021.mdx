    <hr/>
    Hello there! Welcome to the first monthly update for my projects. 
    In case this is your first time hearing about me, or my work, 
    I’m a developer and I often make free and open source software. 
    This month, we’re going to be taking a look at KAaNE for qt, 
    along with a few other things.

    <br/>

    If you don’t know, KAaNE is the very first project I’ve made as a 
    developer. It’s an assistant tool for the game “Keep Talking and 
    Nobody Explodes”, and is basically a way to play the game in 
    single player. As it turns out, this is a wonderful first time 
    project, and I’ve often remade it whenever I want to utilize a 
    new language or framework. The original was for Python 2 and 
    getting used to programming, the Java edition was for...well, 
    Java, and was used for basic GUIs, Android was for mobile 
    development, and now, Qt, for C++, proper cross-platform 
    development, and the Qt framework.

    <br/>

    Because this is a learning experience for me, development is 
    somewhat slow. As you can see, though, there’s already 
    significant progress being made. This is currently using 
    KDDockWidgets, which allows for a much more dynamic layout than 
    in normal programs. There’s still quite a bit to do before an 
    alpha release, like the menu bar, the remaining modules, a README 
    and building instructions, and a way to automatically build using 
    GitHub actions. I’m hoping it’ll be available before the end of 
    September, however, qt can sometimes be very complicated in 
    usually easy areas, even for stuff as simple as an app icon. As 
    for KAaNE on Android, I’m putting my full focus on the first 
    version of the Qt edition, and I’ll start work on it again 
    whenever that version is released.

    <br/>

    As for other news, I’ve finally got a job! It’s a 4 day per week 
    job, so I’ll still be able to work on projects. That being said, 
    progress will obviously slow down, but on the plus side, I’ll be 
    able to afford an actual hosting server. Yay! This also means I 
    won’t need ko-fi donations, however, if you want to donate, I’ll 
    put that money towards programming, whether that’s for an editor 
    on these videos, another programmer, a paid service, or just 
    something else, you can rest assured that it’ll be put towards 
    that.

    <br/>

    And now, for the part you’re probably most interested about, gg 
    bot. Work is currently halted. Between working a job and making 
    two projects, I simply don’t want to stress myself out. However, 
    I am an actively accepting developers to help on it. If you want 
    to join, please send a message through any of my social media 
    accounts. I prefer contact over email for professional work, 
    however, I respond the quickest over Discord, and you’ll be able 
    to see whenever I’m available. Please have your GitHub profile 
    ready, or just any showcase of your previous work. I’m mainly 
    looking for people with experience in Node.JS, HTML, CSS, and 
    plain JavaScript. It would be recommended you’ve had experience 
    with discord.js and web interfaces, however, it’s not necessary. 
    The only thing I’ll ask of you, if you do decide to join, is that 
    you accept your code will be in an open-source project under the 
    GPL3 license.

    <br/>

    And...that’s it. If you want updates, I’ll be using this YouTube 
    channel for monthly updates and other videos, so if you want to 
    see them, please subscribe and turn on notifications. That way, 
    you’ll be notified whenever a video is made. I also have a 
    Discord server, where you can chat with other people and choose 
    what kind of updates you want to receive. Thank you for watching, 
    and have a nice day.
