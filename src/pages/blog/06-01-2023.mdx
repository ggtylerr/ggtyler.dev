    Hey there! Long time no see.

    <br/>

    Okay, I know. I haven't updated in a while. I've started
    college, and along with a part-time job and some hobby
    projects, I just haven't been able to work on this for a
    while. I'm sorry about that.

    <br/>

    It's clear that I need to make changes to the blog schedule,
    (mostly since it hasn't been followed for months,) so -
    posts wheneverâ„¢

    <br/>

    Here's some site updates:

    * [New Frontends page](/other/frontends)
    * Link to frontends on index page
    * [New Privacy Policy](/other/privacy) (don't worry - I'm not collecting any data.)
    * [Added PGP key](/other/pgp-key)
    * Partial fix to the flashbang when switching pages (see [#5](https://github.com/ggtylerr/ggtyler.dev/issues/5))
    * Fixed a bug where theme buttons had their CSS broken 
    when built
    
    <br/>

     This is also a rewrite alongside the new post, since
     I not only wasn't happy with the original, and wanted
     to be more verbose...but Discord somehow managed to make
     **even worse decisions.** You probably already know, it's
     been around the news. I'll get into that specific one a 
     little later, but let's introduce it properly.

     Discord is a chat app, one of the
     most popular, alongside WhatsApp, Telegram,
     Snapchat, and ~~propaganda~~ WeChat. It's primarily targetted
     towards gamers, but has more so shifted to general audiences
     over the years. It *also* happens to be the one I use daily,
     and have been for over 7 years now.

    <br/>
    
     And honestly, I *want* to love it. It's unique, loads of great 
     features, has plenty of charm, is tightly designed, and has 
     basically everyone on it. But unfortunately, as Discord grew
     into the behemoth it is today, it's also made some...questionable
     decisions. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's start
     with the good parts and work our way over there.

    Discord started out as a gaming chat app and as an alternative
    to Skype and TeamSpeak. And as an alternative to those, it's great.
    It recontextualized the normal design of a chat app - instead of
    having a list of contacts, or servers with some voice channels (along
    with an accompanying text channel), it combines the two. You have
    both a friend list with DM and Group DM capabilities, and servers
    with an easily organizable channel list of both text and voice channels.
    
    <br/>
    
    That alone was incredible for 2015. Keep in mind, the most you had
    was Steam, Skype, and TeamSpeak. Steam didn't have voice chat (or even
    group DMs), TeamSpeak is basically voice only, and Skype is ***Skype.***

    <br/>
    
    And this isn't the only thing it added - Emojis, GIFs, Bots, Roles,
    Permissions, loads of features. It's a great app, and...actually, wait, 
    I have more. Screensharing, video chat, announcements, profiles,
    reactions, stickers, webhooks, game presence, stages, forums, probably
    even more that I'm forgetting.

    <br/>
    
    This isn't feature bloat, either. These are all well designed to not
    overwhelm the user, and are all useful in their own right. The app could've
    been a simple chat app, with just strictly text and voice, but it isn't.
    I hesitate to say it, but by definition, it's a full-on social media platform.

    <br/>

    Unfortunately, though, that's not really a good thing.
