    * Brand Kit for Backslash design + ggtyler
    * New favicon
    * Remove placeholder images
    * Fix Tailwind margin and link colors
      - Building + running no longer breaks the site

    Now I'm a supporter for online privacy. I think it's pretty
    reasonable to not have your identity lying around on the internet,
    much like how you don't want everyone to know who you are when
    you're trying to take a dump.

    And when you look at the kinds of data being shared, it's insane
    what companies want to know. [Recently Google made a way to
    control what kind of data you send to advertisers.](https://myadcenter.google.com/controls?ref=my-account&hl=en-GB)
    It covers everything from your gender and age, to home
    ownership and employer size.

    And by the way, I never shared with
    Google that I was employed by a large company - all my business
    emails aren't hosted on GMail, and I haven't used Google's search
    engine in years. (No, I didn't change it in this screenshot.)
    I don't mean to sound conspiratorial or anything, but there's
    definitely a lot of other data not shown here.

<section>
    Of course, there's a very obvious reason why so much is being 
    collected. Yes, there's analytics and whatnot to advertise to
    the right audience, but it also tracks potential illegal
    activity. I'm not talking about torrents or piracy.

    <h1 class="text-2xl">***The following section talks about suicide.***</h1>

    <details>
        <summary>Click to read it. If not, just know it's about an illegal website.</summary>
        There's a website that's abbreviated as "SS", that actively
        encourages users to take their own life. I won't delve into it
        too much since I myself am not comfortable talking about it, plus
        it isn't too relevant to this article, but [Tantacrul made an
        excellent video talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3y6SsGAWks)
        It's how I was made aware of this.

        TL;DW: It's a web forum about suicide. It actively encourages
        users, some of which are minors, to commit suicide. They also
        give "suicide methods", some of which are gruesome.
    </details>

<section>
    Now, why do I bring up such a website? Well, it's not necessarily
    illegal, it broadly falls under Section 230, which prevents site
    owners from being responsible for individual user's actions.

    Generally, it's a good law. It's how sites like YouTube don't get
    shut down after someone uploads something illegal. But it's how
    these sites continue to operate - the owners can say they don't
    partake in them, and thus, the site lives on, even though there's
    clearly something ethically / legally wrong with it.
</section>
<section>
    So, why don't we talk to the owner ourselves?

    This is where CloudFlare comes into the scene. They provide the
    service to the site, including the domain and DDOS protection.
    CF hides the hosting server through a proxy (if they even have
    one), and because of that, it is impossible to get into contact 
    with the original owner without going through them. And
    unfortunately, CF very rarely enforces their ToS, [only taking
    action when absolutely necessarily.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/kiwifarms-blocked/)
</section>
<section>
    This is the ultimate flaw of privacy. It's within its design,
    its very nature, to allow such actions. There is no such thing 
    as "true privacy" without it. So I ask you this, reader: 
    Where do we draw the line? Hell, *how* do we draw it?
    
    Do we let these actions slip under the radar, in the name of
    individual freedom and privacy? Or do we let big brother watch
    over our heads, in the name of security and safety?

    I think only time will tell the real answer.
