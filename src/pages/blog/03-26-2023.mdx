    a few minor additions. After which, the site will be
    in Beta.

    <br/>

    Updates:

    * [New Frontends page](/other/frontends)
    * Link to frontends on index page
    * Fixed a bug where theme buttons had their CSS broken 
    when built

    In case you haven't read it yet, [here's Part 1.](/blog/03-19-2023)
    Go read it, I rant about Discord for 20 paragraphs.
    If you don't want to, or you just need a refresher:
    Discord has some problems. So let's take a look
    at the competition!

        Matrix (and Element (& friends))
    </h4>
    <hr/>
    Matrix is basically the open-source version of Discord
    (or at least the one everyone knows about - we'll
    talk about that later.) It's main deal is that
    it's [federation-based](https://matrix.org/faq/#what-does-federated-mean%3F)
    - basically it allows for multiple hosts to communicate
    to eachother, similar to how torrenting or I2P works.

    <br/>

    This federation, though, is what I believe is the main
    flaw of Matrix. It's a wonderful idea and lots of other
    services do this (like Mastodon and PeerTube.) The
    problem is, if one server is slow, the entire network is.

    <br/>

    Here's a (real world) example: Let's say User A signs up
    for an account. They use Server A (the most popular one)
    and makes a chatroom there. Great! Now they start inviting
    their friends. User B signs up and uses Server B (a 
    self-hosted server.) User B joins the chatroom and starts
    messaging. However, because User B is on Server B (a slower
    server), ***all of their actions are slower*** (since that
    server has to not only connect and send info to users, but
    also to other servers.)

    <br/>

    This may be fine for single messages, but when you start to
    get to more advanced stuff (like searches, or just loading
    older messages,) the problem becomes apparent very quickly.
    This is a core design flaw, and frankly, I don't believe
    this can be patched out without a huge framework change.

    <br/>

    One other quick problem, before we go to the next one -
    clients. The biggest one (Element) is a nightmare to use.
    Even though it's the most feature filled and worked on,
    it has the worst UI and UX design of them all. Good luck
    figuring out how to do anything even slightly complicated.

    <br/>

    I highly recommend you use [FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im/) 
    for mobile and [Cinny for Desktop.](https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny)
    FluffyChat has a very nice Material UI and they have very
    little problems, and Cinny is the closest you'll get to that
    on Desktop (unless you're fine using the browser version.)

        Slack
    </h4>
    <hr/>
    Now, I'll be completely honest. I never used Slack before
    writing this article. I never had the need nor want to -
    even though it's basically the business version of Discord,
    I've done a lot of business over Discord anyways. And from
    the tons of people I met over the years, they all say the
    same.
