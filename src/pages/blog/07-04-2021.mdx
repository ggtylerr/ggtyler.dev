<section>
    In case you're here for 
    [the transparency report (for some reason)](/blog/03-01-2021), 
    here's your report: no cash recieved from Ko-Fi and I'm still 
    looking for a job to pay the bills. The main problem with that 
    right now is that, well...I'm not 18 yet. My birthday is on July 
    30th. Hopefully I'll be able to get one by then, though.

    <br/>

    ***Alright, now for the part you're here for - DSA Bot.*** It's a 
    project I've worked on for a year and a half, and for what it's 
    worth, I'm proud of it, and the final update that just got 
    released. However, if you're a developer or user of the bot, I 
    personally urge you to wait just a little bit longer for its 
    replacement.

    DSA Bot started out as a passion project and in some ways it 
    still is. I've worked on it for a year and half, and I think it's 
    definitely time for some changes. I think it's important to show 
    all the problems, though, so let me try and explain them.

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Brief rundown on the problems in DSA Bot</h3>
    <hr/>
    * **It's really only meant for one small community.**

    DSA Bot is called "DSA" because it's made for the DSA Esports 
    club. Because of that, there's a lot of inside jokes in there 
    (like cough) and generally lesser-made code.

    <br/>
    
    * **Dependence on repl.it**

    Repl.it is a great platform for new coders - it's a free service 
    that lets people run anything they want, from simple scripts to 
    discord bots, all the way to separate other platforms.

    <br/>

    What it isn't great at is being a dedicated hosting service. It's 
    not meant for big projects that lots of people will use, that's 
    just not what its for. In fact, all of it is shared through a 
    handful of IP addresses. That's fine...until you realize it makes 
    APIs and services unusable since everyone is doing it through the 
    same IP.

    <br/>

    That is why, if you use DSA bot and try to play a song, you may 
    get a 429 code. That means there's too many requests, even if 
    there isn't that much through the bot itself, and there's not 
    much we can do about it.

    <br/>

    * **One man job**

    I've briefly talked about it in [my last post,](/blog/06-06-2021) 
    but all of my projects up till now have all been done solo. 
    Of course, they're open source and on GitHub, but there wasn't 
    that much people that knew about them. That was fine at first, 
    but with how many projects are in development, I'm obviously 
    being stretched a bit thin here.

    <br/>

    So, now that we understand what lead me to making a new version, 
    let me show what I have planned.

    <h3 class="text-2xl">The better version</h3> 
    ...It's not E3 anymore, but... ***EXCLUSIVE: WORLD PREMIERE***
    <hr/>
    In collaboration with a few people I met, along with the esports 
    organization that I'm still not allowed to say who they are, I'd 
    like to present - gg bot.

    ![gg bot logo](/gg%20bot.png)
    *Note - Logo is not final.*

    <br/>

    gg bot is a "reimagining" of DSA Bot, in that it's less so a 
    rewrite, but a rethinking of the concepts and commands in the 
    bot. We will be going through everything, improving on what's 
    existing, and trimming out the fat.

    <br/>

    Since development starts right after this post goes up, there's 
    not much I can say about it yet. If you want to help though, feel 
    free to contact me [through any of my socials.](/social) 
    The best way to get to me is either through Discord, Twitter, or 
    Email.

    <h3 class="text-2xl">The future of DSA Bot</h3>
    <hr/>
    With gg bot going to be a thing, what will happen to DSA Bot? 
    Well, until gg bot releases, it will still be up. *This will 
    still be hosted on repl.it, though, so do be wary of 429 errors.* 
    When it releases, though, DSA bot will be shut down.

    <br/>

    Of course, it can still be available through self-hosters and 
    forks, but we still ask that developers wait until gg bot 
    releases. It should only be used as a more fleshed out base for a 
    bot.

    <br/>

    As for the code for DSA Bot itself, it will go into permanent 
    maintenence mode. No features will be added, and only critical 
    bugs and security flaws will be patched. This is to give the most 
    amount of effort to developing gg bot, and for anyone that relies 
    on DSA Bot, we ask that you use gg bot instead. It won't be 
    public domain, but it will be on a license that has very little 
    restrictions (possibly MIT or GPLv3)

    <br/>

    If you still want to check out DSA Bot while it lasts, 
    [you can get the bot here.](/dsabot)

    *If you're reading this at the time of release, please note that 
    this update will be pushed to the master branch and the public 
    discord bot itself at 11:30 AM PT, with it going back up at 12 AM 
    PT. This is to give time to compare changes and to give server 
    owners a chance to prepare for the downtime.*

    Thanks for reading. I still don't really know how to end these 
    besides with the o/, so..... byee!
