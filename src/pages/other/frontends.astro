                Privacy and open source are two pillars of the internet -
                ones that are being taken away. Multiple companies and
                services are constantly trying to fight against them, which
                is why I'm throwing my own hat into the ring.
            </p>

            <br/>

            <p>
                Below is a list of frontends currently being hosted by
                yours truly. They are all unmodified, non-tracking, and
                completely community driven. The current list is small,
                but with your support, not only will there be a complete
                hosting list, but multiple locations will be selectable.
            </p>

            <br/>

            <p>
                Please comment below on any improvements I could do, or
                any problems you're getting. (Though please note that
                if it's a bug directly from the software, you'll need to
                report it to the developers, not me.) I'll also be making
                a server / chatroom soon for this.
            </p>

                <b>Also, pro tip:</b> All links can be replaced with a

                Also - services are auto-restarted and updated every hour.
                Unless specified, they are using Docker builds, which are
                usually ready for production, and thus should not have any
                problems.

            As you may know, Google has been 
            <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/3822">blocking multiple Invidious instances, including mine.</a> 
            The past solution was to move to different, temporary servers. I've been able to get a new primary server in NYC 
            with IPv6, meaning I'll be able to use a better patch - IPv6 address rotation.
            Unfortunately, due to the way QC1 was made and handled, <b>QC1 will be deprecated on the 1st.</b>
            I'm unable to transfer user data due to the risk of GDPR violations,
            so if you still have any leftover data from there (and other nodes):
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://qc1.iv.ggtyler.dev/data_control">Export your user data from the QC1 node</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://iv.ggtyler.dev/login">Make a new account in the current server</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://iv.ggtyler.dev/data_control">Import your user data</a></li>
            </ol>
            I recommend making periodic backups as well. While the US has much more (and cheaper) servers,
            I can't forsee the future and I won't know exactly when this will need to be transferred again.
            <br/><br/>

                <summary>Explanation for QC1 deprecation</summary>
                QC1 (previously hosted on OVH in Quebec City) was a dedicated server that was being shared
                among multiple people, but primarily by me. This was being paid by a good dev friend of mine
                (moocow) who decided they didn't want the server. <i>(Yes, I was paying them a bit as part of my share.)</i>
                Due to the way OVH works, you <b>need</b> to live outside of the US in order to host servers globally.
                I only have a few friends who happen to live outside there, but unfortunately, none of them were willing
                to make an account for me.

                <br/><br/>

                I personally apologize for not giving the exact details or transferring sooner. I had a power outage
                due to a storm (not hurricane hilary) and had very little access to power and data for ~36 hours. Before that,
                I had about a day or so where I could've transferred everything over, but I just haven't been able to have time for it.
                Blame it on depression, college, work, or lazyness, either way I should've done it when I got ssh access, and I didn't.
